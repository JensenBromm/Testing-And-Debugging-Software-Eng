Lab 5

Purpose: 
Prove your debugging skills by figuring out why the Unit Test is failing


Steps:

Lab 5 is a continuation of Lab 4.  In Lab 4, you updated the code in ConvertToHex to work for 32 bit values.

Notice in the ConvertService, the intValue is changed from an int to a long.

1. Run the tests in ConvertServiceTest.  

2. Use your debugging skills to determine why the unit test is failing.  

3. If you find the issue, fix it.

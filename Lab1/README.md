Lab 1

Purpose: Learn and walk through the debugging Tools

Steps: 

1. In the App.java file, in the main() method, add a call to the ConvertService and pass in a proper string value into the constructor.  If you need any help figuring out how to do this, you can "cheat" by looking at the test in ConvertServiceTest.java.

2. Add a breakpoint at this line.  In VSCode, you click to the left of the line number; a red circle should appear indicating the breakpoint has been created.

3. Add another line of code below this to print out the Hexadecimal value provided by the ConvertService.

4. Add another break point at this line of code.

5. Run the code with the debugger turned on.  The first line you created, in step 1, should now be highlighted.  Play with the debugging tools to get a feel for what they do.

6. Using the debugging tools, walk through the code to see what the code is doing.
